    <p><strong>2. Unclean sex life:</strong> After male unclean sex life, the pathogenic bacteria of seminal vesiculitis will pass through the urethra, vas deferens and other parts, and cause seminal vesiculitis through ascending retrograde infection. </p>

    <p><strong>3. Excessive sex life: </strong> Due to excessive labor in the room, the kidneys are damaged, the kidney yin is depleted, the yin is deficient and the fire is hyperactive, and blood semen appears when the sperm chamber is disturbed. Or there is Yin deficiency in the body. Yin deficiency means internal fire is generated. In addition, coupled with strong desire, the blood collaterals in the seminal chamber are damaged, and blood flows with the semen, resulting in hematospermia and symptoms of seminal vesiculitis. </p>
    <p><strong>4. Excessive masturbation: </strong>Frequent masturbation in men can easily lead to prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis and urinary tract infection, which affects the mental state of men, leading to fatigue and low libido. </p>

    <p style="text-indent:2em;">Therapy system integrates water cooling, sound, light and electricity into an all-round three-dimensional treatment, and uses precise 13.56MHZ high-frequency diathermy and infrared spectrum</p>

    <p>The photodynamic effect produced can focus the diseased tissue to generate energy. Through multiple sets of protective external capacitive electrodes, Aurora and the high-precision vision system can precisely locate three-dimensional targets and focus high-frequency energy on human diseased tissues. , producing "aggregated" electromagnetic energy fields and spectral heat. The energy and spectral heat of the electromagnetic field are absorbed by the tissue and converted into heat energy, thereby enhancing blood circulation, improving local tissue metabolism, reducing the tension of muscle and connective tissue, enhancing the phagocytosis of white blood cells, regulating immunity and regulating the function of the body, so as to achieve the purpose of treating body tissues The purpose of subacute and chronic vesiculitis.</p>
